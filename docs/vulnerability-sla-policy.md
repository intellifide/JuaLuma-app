# Vulnerability Remediation SLA Policy

**Effective:** 2026-02-19
**Owner:** Engineering Lead
**Enforcement:** CI pipeline (`ci.yml` security job)

## Severity SLA Thresholds

| Severity | Remediation SLA | CI Enforcement |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| CRITICAL | 24 hours | **Blocks release** — CI fails immediately |
| HIGH | 7 days | **Blocks release** — CI fails immediately |
| MEDIUM | 30 days | Warning only (does not block) |
| LOW | 90 days | Informational (logged, no action) |

## Enforcement Mechanism

1. **pip-audit** scans Python dependencies (`--strict` mode, fails on any known vulnerability)
2. **npm audit** scans Node dependencies (`--audit-level=critical`, fails on critical vulnerabilities)
3. **Trivy** scans the full filesystem for CRITICAL and HIGH severity CVEs (`exit-code=1`, `ignore-unfixed=true`)

All three scanners run on every push and PR to `main` and `Dev` branches.

## Exceptions

- Vulnerabilities with no available fix (`ignore-unfixed: true` in Trivy) are exempt until a fix is published.
- False positives must be documented in `.trivyignore` with a justification comment and reviewed quarterly.

## Escalation

- If a CRITICAL vulnerability cannot be remediated within 24 hours, the affected component must be taken offline or placed behind a feature flag.
- SLA breaches are tracked in the quarterly IAM/security review.
