- Long description uses 3 paragraphs: (1) aggregation summary, (2) budgeting/automation benefits, (3) compliance statements (read-only, no advice, GLBA/GDPR alignment).
- Include mandatory disclaimers verbatim: "jualuma provides informational insights only. No investment, tax, or legal advice."
- Locales: English (US) MVP. Structure copy so future locales can swap strings via `store-listings.json`.

#### 6.5.2 Visual Assets

- **Icons:** Use the refreshed jualuma product icon derived from the Intellifide brand system. Export 1024×1024 (Apple) and adaptive foreground/background layers (Google). No drop shadows or gradients that violate store policies.
- **Screenshots (Apple):** 6 total (6.7" and 6.5" sizes). Narrative order: Dashboard Overview → Aggregated Accounts → Budget Canvas → AI Assistant (with disclaimer caption) → Net Worth Visualization → Security/Privacy commitments. Each frame uses Engineered Liquid Glass template and caption overlays sourced from this document.
- **Screenshots (Google):** 8 total (phone). Same story arc plus Plaid/Web3 connectivity frame and Compliance frame.
- **Feature Graphic (Google Play):** 1024×500 hero referencing the Intellifide corporate logo subtly (watermark only). Text limited to 4 words max.

- TestFlight release notes and Google Play "What's New" text follow the same approved language rules—no promises, no advice, no guarantees.
