<h1>Information Security Policy</h1>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<ul>
<li>Company: Intellifide, LLC (JuaLuma)</li>
<li>Policy Owner: Founder / Security Owner</li>
<li>Security Contact: Trevon Collins (general@intellifide.com)</li>
<li>Effective Date: 2026-02-20</li>
<li>Review Cadence: At least annually and after material system changes or incidents</li>
<li>Classification: Internal</li>
</ul>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<h2>1. Purpose</h2>
<p>This policy defines the controls used to identify, mitigate, and monitor information security risks for JuaLuma systems that process customer and financial data, including Plaid-connected data.</p>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<h2>2. Scope</h2>
<p>This policy applies to:</p>
<ul>
<li>JuaLuma production and non-production environments</li>
<li>Cloud infrastructure and managed services used by JuaLuma</li>
<li>Employees and contractors with access to JuaLuma systems</li>
<li>Application services, APIs, databases, secrets, and logging systems</li>
</ul>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<h2>3. Governance and Accountability</h2>
<ul>
<li>Security ownership is assigned to the Security Owner listed above.</li>
<li>Security responsibilities include access governance, incident response, policy maintenance, and control verification.</li>
<li>Material control changes are documented and reviewed.</li>
</ul>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<h2>4. Identity and Access Management</h2>
<ul>
<li>Access to production systems is restricted to authorized personnel on least-privilege principles.</li>
<li>Role-based access controls (RBAC) are used where available.</li>
<li>Administrative access to critical systems requires MFA.</li>
<li>Non-human system access uses service accounts, managed secrets, and token-based authentication.</li>
<li>Access changes are made when role changes or separation occurs.</li>
</ul>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<h2>5. Data Protection Controls</h2>
<h3>5.1 Data in Transit</h3>
<ul>
<li>Application traffic is served over HTTPS/TLS (TLS 1.2+).</li>
<li>Security headers are enforced at the API layer, including HSTS.</li>
</ul>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<h3>5.2 Data at Rest</h3>
<ul>
<li>Data is stored in managed cloud services with platform-managed encryption at rest.</li>
<li>Plaid access tokens are not stored in plaintext in application code or source control and are persisted via secret management controls.</li>
<li>Sensitive application payloads requiring additional protection are encrypted before storage based on service-level design.</li>
</ul>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<h2>6. Secrets Management</h2>
<ul>
<li>Secrets are stored and retrieved through managed secret storage.</li>
<li>Secrets are not hardcoded in source code.</li>
<li>Secret access is restricted by IAM and service identity.</li>
</ul>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<h2>7. Application and Infrastructure Security</h2>
<ul>
<li>Security middleware is enabled in the backend (request tracing, security headers, API rate limiting).</li>
<li>Authentication and authorization are enforced for protected endpoints.</li>
<li>Plaid webhooks are signature-verified before processing.</li>
<li>Audit logs are generated for sensitive actions.</li>
</ul>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<h2>8. Vulnerability and Patch Management</h2>
<ul>
<li>Code quality and correctness checks run in CI before deployment (linting, tests, type checks).</li>
<li>Security defects identified through development and operations are triaged and remediated by severity.</li>
<li>Critical and high-severity issues are prioritized for accelerated remediation.</li>
</ul>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<h2>9. Incident Response</h2>
<ul>
<li>Security incidents are logged, investigated, and remediated.</li>
<li>Access is restricted or revoked as needed during containment.</li>
<li>Post-incident corrective actions are tracked to closure.</li>
</ul>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<h2>10. Vendor and Third-Party Risk</h2>
<ul>
<li>Third-party providers used for critical services (for example Plaid, cloud platform, payment providers) are reviewed as part of deployment and operational risk management.</li>
<li>Integrations are limited to required scopes and credentials.</li>
</ul>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<h2>11. Policy Exceptions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Any exception to this policy must be documented, approved by the Security Owner, time-bounded, and reviewed for closure.</li>
</ul>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<h2>12. Enforcement</h2>
<p>Violations of this policy may result in access removal and other corrective actions.</p>
<div class="spacer"></div>
