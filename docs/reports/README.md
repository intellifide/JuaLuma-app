# Reports Directory Policy

This directory is for dated point-in-time reports only.

- Files in `docs/reports/` are historical snapshots, not source-of-truth policy.
- Do not update old dated reports in place to represent current state.
- Add a new dated report for each new audit run.
- Keep canonical policy/runbook content in undated docs under `docs/`, `docs/runbooks/`, `ops/`, and `scripts/`.
