review https://www.notion.so/Finity-app-2c22c5428b0880a9b6c7d265d452f79e?v=ec7b8e3634a34645b86e977f56f506e2&source=copy_link  using the notion mcp server. the focus is on the page titled "Local Development Tasks Part 2". your task is to review, execute, and iterate the tasks I outline below. If I mention a task that has already be labeled complete do not move forward and make it know to me. mark the task in progress when you start it. mark it complete when you finish.
